#3 Analysis:
After implementing and debugging my code I ran the test case and after looking at the graph it seems that the function most closely fits the graph would be f(n)= n 

#4 Logistics
My code implements Hash functions to use the graph and colors already there to populate and determine the size of the graph.  I only need to specify the coordinates and leave it up to the flood fill routine to find out what color is at that location. I would define another method that is public, and make the recursive method a private implementation method. The public method would look up the color at the location and run if and for loops to switch my colors.

#5 Measuring the Execution time
Graphed saved as png file
I thought when I ran the graph that is was going to be f(n) = n^2
