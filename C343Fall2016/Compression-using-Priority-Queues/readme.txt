The minimium class is a simple class that gets the element at key 0.
The extract min class class starts with an base if statement that is nothing is in the heap it returns null. Copy the last value in the array to the root and decrease heap's size by 1. Root has two children. Swap root's value with the smallest.
The insert class adds a new element to the end of an array. After insertion, the element keeps swapping with its parents until its in the right spot.

I spent about around 10 hours on this code getting help from the lab AI's, going to the tutoring session, and people in the class
