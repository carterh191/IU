The Intersection class provides methods for determiningthe intersection point of two lines and the intersection point of a line and a general path object. The Point object where the two lines intersect. the code returns null if the two lines do not intersect. The GUIdriver sets up the graph of the dimensions of where we draw the lines. the segmenintersection files calculates the lines and the coordinates in 2d and determines if and where they intersect at.
