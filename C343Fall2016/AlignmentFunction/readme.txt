The maximum value of the score of the alignment located in the cell (N-1,M-1) and the algorithm will trace back from this cell to the first entry cell (1,1) to produce the resulting alignment . IF the value of the cell (j,i) has been computed using the value of the diagonal cell, the alignment will contain the Seq2[j] and Seq1[i]. IF the value has been computed using the above cell, the alignment will contain Seq2[j] and a Gap in Seq1[i]. IF the value has been computed using the left cell, the alignment will contain Seq1[i] and a Gap in Seq2[j]. the resulting alignment will produce completely by traversing the cell (N-1,M-1) back towards the initial entry of the cell (1,1).
