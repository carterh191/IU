A.1

The single-destination shortest-paths problem can be solved with the following algorithm:
* transform the problem to a single-source shortest-paths problem: reverse the direction of all edges (e.g. A->B would become B->A) 
* apply Dijkstra's single-source shortest path algorithm to the transformed graph
* the results from Dijkstra's single-source shortest path algorithm for the transformed graph are the same paths that also solve the single-destination shortest-paths problem for the original graph.

A.2

The collection of edges selected by Dijkstra's algorithm form a spanning tree: they're a tree that is formed by a subset of all edges in the graph, and they cover all nodes in the graph.
They may or may not form an MST, since there's no guarantee that the total sum of all edges' weights is the minimum of all such sums on the graph.
